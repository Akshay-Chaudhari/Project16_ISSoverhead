# Project16_ISSoverhead
This is very interesting project where we get message when International Space Station moves exactly from our top.
In this project we set our location with the help of coordinates.
We matches this coordinates with the coordinates of International Space Station (IIS).
When this two coordinates match, we get message.
This means that ISS is on the top of our head at the time of message we get.
